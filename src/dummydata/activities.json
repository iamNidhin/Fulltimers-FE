After the first team knocks the stones over, the second team will get the ball and try to hit players from the opposing team. \n 5: At the same time, the first team will try to restack the pile of stones and trace a circle around them three times with their finger. They try to do this before the other team knocks all of their players out. If they succeed, they get one point and also the chance to hit the stones again. \n 6: If they fail to do this and all players are out, the defending team will gain the point and they will now have a turn to hit the pile of stones. \n 7: When the defending team tries to throw the ball at the opposing team, they must not move around with the ball in their hands. The player with the ball must stand in the place where he or she caught the ball and throw it. The ball should not remain in the player\u2019s hands for more than 5 seconds.",
